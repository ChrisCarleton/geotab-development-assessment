As part of your application to FleetCarma, we ask that you complete the following challenge. 

### Task 1 - Fix some ugly code ###

Imagine a tool written many years ago by an unknown person, which has since been used every year to query the Edmunds api to determine what new electric vehicles are on the market. The tool is not written well, needs a few tweaks every year but works well enough. 

Your task as a professional developer is to clean up this tool and make it something you can be proud of.

*Note: This is NOT a representation of our codebase to be clear. We did have fun crafting this beauty however ;)*

### Task 2 - Write a report ###

Write a document explaining some of the improvements you made to the code, and why you did so.

### What do I need? ###

* [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) - any platform
* Edmunds API key - get one here [http://developer.edmunds.com/]( http://developer.edmunds.com/)

### Who do I talk to? ###

If you have any questions you can email hr@fleetcarma.com
